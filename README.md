## Architecture Overview

StudyNotion follows a classic client-server model with three core components:

- **Front-end:** Developed using ReactJS, delivering a dynamic and responsive user interface that communicates with the server through RESTful APIs.
- **Back-end:** Powered by Node.js and Express.js, responsible for handling authentication, course operations, payment processing, and more.
- **Database:** MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database that stores all user profiles, course data, ratings, and other essential information.
